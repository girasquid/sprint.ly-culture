# CSS Standards & Conventions

This is a temporary document for Sprint.ly CSS standards which will hopefully be replaced soon by a living styleguide.

## General

Selectors should abide by [The Inception Rule](http://thesassway.com/beginner/the-inception-rule) and should try not to go more than 4 levels deep in order to promote modularity, simplicity, and performance. Simple class names are encouraged, and nesting should only be done if absolutely necessary to avoid being unnecessarily specific. For the same reason, we should generally avoid binding classes to specific elements. For example, `.my-module-title` is preferred over `h3.my-module-title`). Care should be taken to avoid over-classing (classitis) our application as well.

Selector structure should be relatively independent of of the actual HTML markup.

## Categorization

When writing CSS, we generally try to follow the guidelines of [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) (the whole book is [available online](http://smacss.com/book/)). Your definitions should generally fall in to one of the following categories:

*   **Base**
    
    Styling of specific HTML tags, e.g. `body`, which should be used very sparingly
*   **Layout**
    
    Tools for page layout, like grid systems, columns, etc., as well as page types (e.g. "logged out" vs. "logged in" pages) or even specific pages. This is usually styling that modules (see below) will fall into to determine how they are positioned/flowing on a page. Class names in this category must be prefixed with `.layout-`.
*   **Module**
    
    This is where most of the meat is. Module styles should represent styling for a block of content and should be relatively self-contained and avoid too much dependency on other CSS. `id` selectors should almost always be avoided here as `id`s are meant to represent a single element on a page, which is at odds with the concept of modularity.

    For example, in cases where we might have a lot of similar property definitions, it might be tempting to combine selectors like so:

    ```css
    .my-module,
    .some-unrelated-module {
        border: 1px solid #333;
        color: #ccc;
        font-family: Helvetica;
        padding: 5px;
    }
    ```

    But we want to avoid this kind of interdependency in our CSS, so an additional class should be used for cases like this:

    ```css
    .pretty-box {
        border: 1px solid #333;
        color: #ccc;
        font-family: Helvetica;
        padding: 5px;
    }

    .my-module {
        ...
    }

    .some-unrelated-module {
        ...
    }
    ```
    ```html
    <div class="pretty-box my-module">...</div>
    <div class="pretty-box some-unrelated-module">...</div>
    ```
*   **State**
    
    Styling for transient element states (usually modules or parts of a module) that can be applied or removed falls here. Class names in this category must be prefixed with `.is-` or `.has-` (or similar), e.g. `.is-active`, `.is-animating`, etc.

## Colors

We have absolutely no standards about how colors should be done. We equally support `#fff`, `#fffff`, `white` or the scss variable name `$this-isnt-white-at-all: white`. No using `hsla` or other color schemes. Hex colors or the built-in ones only. Feel free to put colors anywhere and use as many shade variations as you like. All the better if you use scss math to come up with them so they're completely un-greppable.


## Selectors

Selector names must be lower case and hyphenated, like so:

```css
#layout-signup-page .registration-form { ... }
```

`ids` should generally be avoided for the reasons mentioned above in the **Module** category, but are  acceptable for **Layout** styling, as well as for use by Javascript if necessary.

## LESS

Similar to selectors, all LESS variables must be lower case and hyphenated like so:

```less
@dark-grey: #222;
```

## Documentation

Modules with at least a moderate level of complexity should include markup examples in the comments.

Eventually, we would like to use [KSS](https://github.com/kneath/kss) to maintain a living styleguide, so referencing it for your commenting/documentation formatting is encouraged.

## Javascript

When using class names in Javascript, a `js-` prefix must be used. Class names with a `js-` prefix must *never* be present in a CSS document and if the element in question must be styled, it must 
have an additional, non-js-prefixed CSS class applied to it. The purpose of this is to keep our Javascript code as decoupled from our CSS as we can so that, for example, if you wanted to 
add/remove/modify class names, it doesn't break any Javascript functionality.

Example:

```html
<p>Click <a href="#" class="open-info-link js-open-info">this thing</a> to get more info.</p>
```
```css
.open-info-link {
    color: red;
}
```
```javascript
$('a.js-open-info').click(function(e) {
    var view = new InfoView();
    view.render();
});

```

## No `clearfix` in the Markup

As our application exists now, a `clearfix` class exists and is being using in countless HTML templates. Eventually these should not exist, as it's unnecessary clutter in the markup. Instead, the `.clearfix()` LESS mixin should be used, which should be applied to an element containing floated elements that need to be cleared.

## (Almost) Never Use `!important`

If you're using `!important`, you are very likely doing something bad. This usually implies that you are trying to override an overly-specific selector (see [The Inception Rule](http://thesassway.com/beginner/the-inception-rule)) and something should probably be refactored.
